# Conway's Game of Life

This project is a Pygame-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input from the player. The user can draw cells on a grid, start and stop the simulation, adjust the speed of the iterations using a slider, and zoom in and out of the grid using the scroll wheel while holding the Ctrl key. Additionally, a mini-map is provided to give a small-scale overview of the entire grid, which updates in real-time as you interact with the main grid.

Features
- Drawing & Erasing: Use the left mouse button to draw cells and the right mouse button to erase them.
- Simulation Control: Start, pause, and stop the simulation with on-screen buttons.
- Speed Adjustment: Adjust the speed of the iterations using an on-screen slider.
- Zooming: Zoom in and out of the grid using the scroll wheel while holding the Ctrl key.
- Mini-map: A real-time mini-map provides a zoomed-out view of the entire grid.
